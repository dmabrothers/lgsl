Description: A numerical library for Lua based on GSL
 LGSL is a collection of numerical algorithms and functions for Lua, based on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). It allows matrix/vector manipulation and linear algebra operations.
 .
 LGSL is not just a wrapper over the C API of GSL but offers a much more simple and expressive way to use GSL. The objective of LGSL is to give the user the power to easily access GSL functions without having to write a complete C application.
 .
 LGSL is based on the numerical modules of GSL Shell.
