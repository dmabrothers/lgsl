Install Instructions
--------------------

LGSL is implemented as a set of Lua files and depends on LuaJIT (version 2.0 or
higher) and on the GSL library (version 1.14 or higher).  As the implementation
is in Lua, no compilation is needed.

The standard method to install the files is to type "make install" from the
source directory.  The command will install all the required files in a
system-wide directory in the package search path of Lua and requires sudo
privileges.  Before installing you may change the PREFIX directory in
"Makefile" or with "make install PREFIX=/path/to/install".

The easiest way to install and update LGSL is with LuaRocks. 

> luarocks install lgsl-<version>.rockspec

For instance, to install the latest development version, run

> luarocks install https://rawgit.com/ladc/lgsl/master/lgsl-scm-1.rockspec

On Debian-based systems like Ubuntu or Debian itself, the package can be
installed from a Debian package.  The command "make debian" or simply "make"
will build a Debian package in the source code directory.  Once the package is
created, it can be installed with sudo privileges using the command:

> sudo dpkg -i <name-of-debian-package>

Recommended Packages

Manual Installation
-------------------

To manually install the package, the files contained in the "lgsl" directory
should be copied inside a folder named "lgsl". This latter shoud be copied in a
directory included in the standard Lua search path such as /usr/share/lua/5.1.
The files included in lgsl/templates should be included as well by copying them
in a subfolder named "templates".
