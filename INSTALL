Install Instructions
--------------------

LGSL is implemented as a set of Lua files and does depend on LuaJIT 2.0 and on the GSL Library at least with the version 1.14.
As the implementation is in Lua no compilation is needed.

The standard method to install the files is to type "make install" from the source directory.
The command will install all the required files in a system-wide directory in the package search path of Lua and requires sudo privileges.
Before installing you may change the PREFIX directory in "Makefile".

On Debian based systems like Ubuntu or Debian itself the package can be installed by using a Debian package.
The command "make debian" or simply "make" will build a debian package in the source code directory.
Once the package is created it can be installed with sudo privileges using the command:

> sudo dpkg -i <name-of-debian-package>

Recommended Packages

If you want to create some plots you may install the Lua Graphics Toolkit.
This latter can be found on github at the address:

Manual Installation
-------------------

To install manually the package the files contained in the "src" directory should be copied inside a folder named "lgsl". This latter shoud be copied in a directory included in the standard Lua search path such as /usr/share/lua/5.1.
The files included in src/templates should be included as well by copying them in a subfolder named "templates".
