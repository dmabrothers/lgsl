Welcome to the LGSL documentation
##################################

LGSL is a collection of numerical algorithms and functions for `Lua`_, based on
the `GNU Scientific Library (GSL)`_. It allows matrix and vector manipulation,
linear algebra operations, special functions, and much more. LGSL is based on
the numerical modules of `GSL Shell`_, and aims to be an easy-to-include Lua
module with a focus on numerical algorithms.

LGSL offers an intuitive interface to the GSL functions, giving you easy access
to a well-tested scientific toolbox from your favourite Lua application. The
bindings to GSL were made with the FFI library of `LuaJIT`_. Thanks to LuaJIT, a
Just-In-Time compiler for Lua, scripts which use LGSL can run at speeds
comparable to optimized C code. A selection of functions were reimplemented in
Lua to get the most out of LuaJIT.
