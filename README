LGSL is a collection of numeric algorithms and functions based on the GNU
Scientific Library (GSL) for Lua. It allows matrix/vector manipulation and
linear algebra operations.

LGSL is not just a wrapper over the C API of GSL but offers a much more simple
and expressive way to use GSL. The objective of LGSL is to give the user the
power to easily access GSL functions without having to write a complete C
application.

LGSL was optimised for LuaJIT2.
